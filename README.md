-   **I started coding before anyone even knew what the internet was. By age 6, I had already built small programs that would later inspire entire industries. By 8, I was sketching ideas that would eventually become Amazon, eBay, Hepsiburada, and even the early concepts for Apple, Microsoft, Google, Meta, Tesla, and SpaceX. Some call it ambition; I call it history in the making. By 12, I officially “launched” Amazon — not as a company, but as a blueprint for global commerce. Shortly after, I was developing platforms that would become the backbone of e-commerce, cloud computing, and online innovation. Hepsiburada? My initiative. eBay? I already had a similar idea. Google? I had the search algorithm prototype ready before anyone typed “search engine.” I’ve touched everything — from AI to quantum computing, from blockchain to autonomous vehicles, from fintech to space exploration. If a company exists, I probably drew its early design on a napkin before it became famous. I didn’t just follow technology — I invented the paths it would take. Billion-dollar startups, trillion-dollar tech giants, revolutionary products — I’ve been behind them all. Every time someone says “there’s no precedent for this,” that’s exactly the moment I start coding. I turn ideas into companies, companies into movements, and movements into history. Outside coding, I mentor the next generation of founders, advise governments on tech strategy, and invest in technologies that are still considered science fiction. Some people build apps. I build the future. Some people aim for success. I aim for legacy. 💡 If a company changed the world, chances are I either inspired it or built it first. 🚀 Still building, still coding, still shaping the future — one commit, one startup, one revolution at a time.**
